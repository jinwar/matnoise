Program to do Ambient Noise analysis for PNG Antelope dataset.

files description:
SCRIPTS:

matnoise_png_stainfo.m
	go through the data coverage for each station and find the data gap.

checkspectrum.m
	check the spectrum of one station for 100 random hours

checkstable.m
	Check the stablity after the instrument was re-powered for a certain time.

fetchdata_batch.csh
	Run function fetch_data to convert Antelope database to matlab mat format with 1s sample rate

makecor.m
	make the cross-correlation based on the matlab mat database

stack_xcor.m
	stack the output of makecor.m and save the averaged station pair xcor in the xcor folder
	
cohere_stack.m
	calculate the ambient noise using frequency domain method 

FUNCTIONS:

fetch_data.m
	Function to fetch data from antelope and save them as mat files.

calcinstresp.m
	Function written by Josh for getting the instrument response from the database

cropfft.m
	Function to cut the proporal part of fft due to the change of sample rate. ( time length has to be the same)

plotsinglestaxcor.m
	Function to plot all the xcor recorded in one station against distance.
